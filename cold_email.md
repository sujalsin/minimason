**Subject**: I built a working prototype based on your "LLM Communications in the Wild" post

Hi Michael,

I read your "LLM Communications in the Wild" post and your "Being There" essay, and something clicked. The clogged-toilet-at-2-AM example, the blurry photos, the tenant who says "emergency!!" when it's really a medium-priority drip — I've seen this exact chaos pattern in production systems, and your framing of it was the clearest I've encountered.

So I built something. **MiniMason** is a working prototype that takes a messy tenant message (+ optional blurry iPhone photo) and produces:
- A structured work order with severity classification using your exact criteria
- A "suave and gentle" tenant reply, ready to send
- Red flag detection: self-diagnosis, scope creep, rent frustration, vendor upsell, delayed reporting
- Suggested actions with specific timing

It's not a mockup — it's a live app powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash with a 2,500-word system prompt that encodes everything from your severity table to your tone calibration rules. The 10 demo scenarios are built from real patterns you described.

**Here's a 2-minute Loom showing it in action**: [INSERT LOOM LINK]
**Live demo** (if you want to try it): [INSERT STREAMLIT CLOUD LINK]

The reason I built this isn't just to demonstrate technical skill — it's because your philosophy of showing up in person with something concrete resonates deeply with how I work. Everything great comes from sitting with real operators and building together in the room. This prototype is me showing up.

I'd love 20 minutes to talk about what you're building at Mason and how I could contribute. I'm [LOCATION]-based and happy to come to you.

Best,

## SENDING TIPS

1. **Send on Tuesday or Wednesday morning** (8–10 AM PT)
2. **Keep the subject line exactly as written** — it's specific and shows you did the work
3. **Record the Loom BEFORE sending** and make sure the link works
4. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud first** so the live demo link works
5. **Follow up once** after 5 business days if no response — brief, no pressure
6. **No attachments** — everything should be a link
