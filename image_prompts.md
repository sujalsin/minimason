# 📸 MiniMason — Sample Image Generation Prompts

Use these prompts in **Gemini** (gemini.google.com), **Grok Imagine**, **Midjourney**, or **DALL-E** to generate realistic tenant-submitted maintenance photos for testing MiniMason.

Each prompt is designed to produce images that look like real tenant submissions — messy, urgent, poorly lit, and authentic.

## 🎯 Usage Tips

- **For best results**, specify "no watermark, no text overlay" if the tool adds those
- **Regenerate** 2-3 times per prompt to get the most realistic option
- **Save as JPEG** (not PNG) for realistic file sizes and compression artifacts
- These images are designed to test MiniMason's ability to analyze blurry, dark, and poorly framed tenant photos — just like the real thing
